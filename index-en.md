<h2 class="centered">Investigations</h2>
<p class='description'>In November 2015, we launched CrowdNewsroom. Since then, we have carried out five elaborate investigations together with many citizens via the platform.

            <h3>Who owns Minden</h3>
            <p>The local newspaper Mindener Tageblatt launched our common project „Who owns Minden?“ in march 2019. Minden is a mid-sized town in Westfalia. There is a growing debate about the affordable rent market or anonymous investors. Minden is the fifths project we launched to find out more about the intransparent housing market together with the citizens.</p>

            <h3>Who owns Heidenheim</h3>
            <p>Finding apartments to rent is increasingly problematic, not only in the big cities, but also in smaller towns. For investors, the real estate market in smaller cities is attractive as they can make high revenues. In the city of Heidenheim, located in southern Germany, we started the project „Who owns Heidenheim?“ together with the Heidenheimer Zeitung in february 2019.</p>

            <h3>Who owns Hamburg?</h3>
            <p>In cooperation with the Hamburger Abendblatt, we launched our "Who owns" series in April of 2018. We wanted to find out from tenants residing in Hamburg who the owners of their apartments are, in order to make the real estate market more transparent. We published the results in late November, 2018.</p>

            <h3>Cancellation of classes in Dortmund</h3>
            <p>In March 2017, we covered the cancellation of classes across schools in Dortmund. Over 500 parents, teachers and students used CrowdNewsroom to track canceled classes at their schools. The result: The issue of class cancellation at German schools is greater than the statistics published by the authorities in Germany's largest federal state.</p>

            <h3>Sparkassen-Check</h3>
            <p>Over 800 citizens investigated the savings banks in their region until the end of 2016. They assisted with analyzing annual accounts, photographed fee schedules and inquired about donations lists at their savings bank. This allowed us to compile information on bad loans, executive salaries and excessive overdraft fees.</p>
