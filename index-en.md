<h2 class="centered">Investigations</h2>
<p class='description'>In November 2015, we launched CrowdNewsroom. Since then, we have carried out five elaborate investigations together with many citizens via the platform.

            <h3>Who owns Berlin?</h3>
            <p>We have been doing joint investigations with tenants residing in Berlin. Together with the Tagesspiegel, we aim to ascertain the causes of the rent madness in Germany's capital. For the fact of the matter is that he who owns the apartment decides the rent.</p>

            <h3>Who owns DÃ¼sseldorf?</h3>
            <p>We have been doing joint investigations with tenants residing in Dusseldorf. The local cooperation partner is the Rheinische Post newspaper. Together, we want to find out more about the owners of rental apartments. Our goal is to uncover who benefits from the lack of transparency in the real estate market.</p>

            <h3>Who owns Hamburg?</h3>
            <p>In cooperation with the Hamburger Abendblatt, we launched our "Who owns" series in April of 2018. We wanted to find out from tenants residing in Hamburg who the owners of their apartments are, in order to make the real estate market more transparent. We published the results in late November, 2018.</p>

            <h3>Cancellation of classes in Dortmund</h3>
            <p>In March 2017, we covered the cancellation of classes across schools in Dortmund. Over 500 parents, teachers and students used CrowdNewsroom to track canceled classes at their schools. The result: The issue of class cancellation at German schools is greater than the statistics published by the authorities in Germany's largest federal state.</p>

            <h3>Sparkassen-Check</h3>
            <p>Over 800 citizens investigated the savings banks in their region until the end of 2016. They assisted with analyzing annual accounts, photographed fee schedules and inquired about donations lists at their savings bank. This allowed us to compile information on bad loans, executive salaries and excessive overdraft fees.</p>
